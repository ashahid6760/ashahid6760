As a highly motivated computer science graduate, I am eager to take on new challenges and utilize my skills to drive innovation in the fields of data science and software development. With a strong academic background in Computer Science and hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies, I am dedicated to delivering exceptional results.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. This academic journey has provided me with a deep understanding of fundamental concepts and practical skills in the field. I have acquired expertise in programming languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript, enabling me to tackle diverse software development tasks with confidence.

Throughout my academic journey and professional experience, I have developed proficiency in web development using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, allowing me to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. Furthermore, I have gained valuable experience in working with databases, particularly SQL, and designing optimized database structures.

In the realm of big data, I possess knowledge and experience with technologies such as Hadoop, PySpark, and Kafka, enabling me to effectively handle and analyze large-scale datasets. I am also well-versed in version control systems like Git, ensuring seamless collaboration and efficient code management within a development team.

Frameworks such as Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are part of my toolkit, allowing me to develop robust and scalable applications. Additionally, I have expertise in working with Eureka, which is a service discovery and registration framework in microservices architecture. Eureka enables services to locate and communicate with each other dynamically, making it easier to build and manage scalable microservices-based systems.

I am adept at handling data exchange using XML, JSON, and SOAP, and possess the expertise to develop and integrate web services seamlessly, utilizing Apache CXF. In terms of containerization and API gateway functionalities, I have leveraged Docker and Netflix Zuul, respectively, to design and develop distributed systems that are scalable, resilient, and efficient.

I am actively seeking roles in the fields of data science or software development where I can leverage my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and continue to learn and grow in a dynamic environment.
